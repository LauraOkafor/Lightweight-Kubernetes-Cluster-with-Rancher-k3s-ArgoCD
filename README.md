# ðŸš€ GitOps with Rancher, k3s, and ArgoCD

This project demonstrates how to provision infrastructure with **Terraform**, set up a lightweight **Kubernetes cluster (k3s)** managed by **Rancher**, and enable a **GitOps workflow** with **ArgoCD**.  

The goal is to show how DevOps teams can automate infrastructure, deploy applications via Git, and achieve **self-healing & continuous delivery** in the cloud.
